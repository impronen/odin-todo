Modules or controllers needed:

1) Task storage
2) Task controller / creator 
2.5) Task creator in DOM (visual representation to feed information to task controller)
3) Project controller (as these will be relatively simple, there is no need for seperate storage)
3.5) Project creator in DOM
4) Layout creator (to create overall layout)
5) Task UI controller (renders the tasks as cards on the screen - contains methods for filtering view)

1) TASK STORAGE


2) TASK CONTROLLER / CREATOR 

Creates an task object.
Object needs to contain datapoints for: 
    -name
    -Project
    -priority (low / medium / high)
    -due date
    -completion status
    -additional info on task 

Object needs to contain methods for manipulating these data points (see here if 
inheritance can be used to benefit) such as marking completed, editing descripition, changing
from project to another, etc. So that task ui controller can tap to them but they remain selfcontained.
